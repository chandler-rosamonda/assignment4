              <td>I just recieved a gun that I can use to sketch patters into my wooden boxes. This will allow me to eventuall create custom designs and logos. I am trying to learn how to use this for now. I will keep you all updated in that regard. </td>

              <td>I am still working on learning how to use the gun that lets me sketch patterns. It is a lot more difficult than I expected. I have burned through many boxes, though it is really fun. Besides this I have been trying to learn how to stain glass in a differnt way. This is so I can create bigger pieces eventually.</td>
